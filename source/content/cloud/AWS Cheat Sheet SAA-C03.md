* Storage autoscaling can be enabled on a running RDS.
* Enable RDS encryption:
  1. Create snapshot
  1. Copy the snapshot with encryption enabled
  1. Restore DB using encrypted snapshot

---

### Aurora

* Aurora is Highly Available: 2 copies of data are kept in each AZ with a minimum of 3 AZ.
* Aurora Serverless v2 scales compute capacity automatically based on actual usage, **down to zero when not in use**.

---

### DynamoDB

* DynamoDB is highly scalable.

* There are 2 read types:
  
  * **Query (using Index):** I know what I'm looking for.
  * **Scan:** Scan all the database to find what I'm looking for.
* An Index is composed of 2 keys:
  
  * The **Partition Key** is used to group the data. Data with the same Partition Key is stored together (this allows to query a "partition" in 1 query).
  * The **Sort Key** is optional, it determines the way data with the same Partition Key is stored.
* For better performance, the keys have to be well architected in order to use Queries instead of Scanning the database.

* AWS offers the ability to add a secondary Index (warning, paid by hour).
