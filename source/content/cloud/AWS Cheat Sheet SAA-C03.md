|Running K8s on premise but use AWS-managed service for managing multiple clusters of nodes|EKS Anywhere|

---

### ECS

* ECS Anywhere requires the installation of AWS System Manager (this allows the agent to register itself).

---

### EKS

* EKS distribution includes open-source K8S components only.

# Database

---

### Service / Requirement

|Requirement|Service|
|-----------|-------|
|Graph database, highly connected datasets|Amazon Neptune|
|Time series database for IoT|Amazon Timestream|
|HA and scalable database supporting Cassandra|Amazon Keyspaces|
|Petabyte scale database|Amazon Redshift|

### RDS

* RDS only support IO1, it does not support IO2 or IO2express
* Storage autoscaling can be enabled on a running RDS.
* Enable RDS encryption:
  1. Create snapshot
  1. Copy the snapshot with encryption enabled
  1. Restore DB using encrypted snapshot

---

### Aurora

* Aurora is Highly Available: 2 copies of data are kept in each AZ with a minimum of 3 AZ.
* Aurora Serverless v2 scales compute capacity automatically based on actual usage, **down to zero when not in use**.

---

### DynamoDB

* DynamoDB is highly scalable.

* There are 2 read types:
  
  * **Query (using Index):** I know what I'm looking for.
  * **Scan:** Scan all the database to find what I'm looking for.
* An Index is composed of 2 keys:
  
  * The **Partition Key** is used to group the data. Data with the same Partition Key is stored together (this allows to query a "partition" in 1 query).
  * The **Sort Key** is optional, it determines the way data with the same Partition Key is stored.
* For better performance, the keys have to be well architected in order to use Queries instead of Scanning the database.

* AWS offers the ability to add a secondary Index (warning, paid by hour).

### VPC

* **The default NACL in the default VPC allow all traffic in and out.**
* **Security Groups deny all in and allow all out by default.**
* Each subnet has a single Route Table. The VPC and all its subnets are always reachable via the default `local`route (it cannot be modified or removed).
* VPC Peering is not transitive: a VPC cannot use the NAT Gateway of a peered VPC.
* **A VPC cannot reference the security group of a peer VPC that's in a different Region.**
* VPC Endpoint work with Kinesis.
* VPC Endpoint always takes precedence (priority) over NAT Gateway or Internet Gateway.
