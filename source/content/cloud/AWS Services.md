### WAF & Shields

![Arch_AWS-WAF_48.svg](../../attachments/Arch_AWS-WAF_48.svg)

To create a WAF protection, it is required to first create a condition (like `Geo match` for example), and then create a rule using this condition.
After that, create an ACL (Access Control List) with the rule previously created and associate it to the resource to protect (a Load Balancer for example).

Summary: ACL based on a Rule using a Condition.

VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud. It's Virtual Network in which to place Virtual Machines. A VPC reside in a Region (this means it is available to all Availability Zones within the Region). 

In order to build a highly available network, it is recommended to deploy it in at least two Availability Zones.

---

### CloudFront (CDN)

![Arch_Amazon-CloudFront_48.svg](../../attachments/Arch_Amazon-CloudFront_48.svg)

CloudFront improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos) and dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery).

CDN with over 160 points of presence. Creating a distribution takes around 10-15 min.

Only outgoing bandwidth is charged (and CloudFront's costs around 10-15% less than S3's).

---

### Global Accelerator

![Arch_AWS-Global-Accelerator_48.svg](../../attachments/Arch_AWS-Global-Accelerator_48.svg)

Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.

Use cases: 

* Good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP.
* Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses.
* Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover.

---

### ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)

![Arch_Elastic-Load-Balancing_48.svg](../../attachments/Arch_Elastic-Load-Balancing_48.svg)

ELB is a managed load balancer (by AWS).
It costs more than a self-managed load balancer, but it is effortless to manage.

ELB allows "Sitckiness" (Session Affinity): a user will end up using the same instance.

---

### Network ACL vs Security Group

![AWS-Service-NACL_Security_Group.png](../../attachments/AWS-Service-NACL_Security_Group.png)

#### Network ACL

A NACL is bound to a Subnet. It only applies (evaluate a packet) when crossing a subnet.

A Security group is **Stateless** (check very packets that cross border).

* Stateless firewall
* Access Control In
* Access Control Out

The `Defaut Network ACL` of an AWS allows all inbound and outbound traffic

#### Security Group

A Security Group is bound to an ENI (Elastic Network Interface). It applies to check if packets can reach specific instances or not:

* Protocol (UDP or TCP),
* Port Range,
* Source.

**The source can be another Security Group!** 

A Security group is **Stateful**.

* Stateful firewall,
* Deny all Inbound traffic by default,
* Allow all Outbound traffic by default,
* Can only create "Allow" rules.

# Compute

---

### EBS (Elastic Bock Store)

![Arch_Amazon-Elastic-Block-Store_48.svg](../../attachments/Arch_Amazon-Elastic-Block-Store_48.svg)

#### Basis

Amazon Elastic Block StoreÂ is a service that provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with Amazon EC2 instances. If you stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains available.

**Block storage** breaks files in small blocks: when a change is made to the file, only modified blocks are re-uploaded.

Multi Attach EBS max to 16 instances.

#### EBS FSR

Amazon EBS Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR) enables you to create a volume from a snapshot that is fully initialized at creation. This eliminates the latency of I/O operations on a block when it is accessed for the first time.

---

### EFS (Elastic File System)

![Arch_Amazon-EFS_48.svg](../../attachments/Arch_Amazon-EFS_48.svg)

EFS (Elastic File System) allows you to have multiple EC2 instances accessing data at the same time.

---

### AWS Backup

![Arch_AWS-Backup_48.svg](../../attachments/Arch_AWS-Backup_48.svg)

AWS Backup is a simple and cost-effective way to protect your data by backing up your Amazon EFS file systems. Amazon EFS is natively integrated with AWS Backup.

---

### S3 vs EBS vs EFS

#### S3 vs EBS

S3:

* When using complete objects or occasional changes.

EBS: 

* When using complex read, write change functions.

#### EBS vs EFS

EBS: 

* It's a volume attached to EC2 instances.
* Availability Zone level resource (requires to be in the same AZ as the EC2 instances to be attached to it).

EFS: 

* Multiple instances can read and write at the same time.
* Linus file system (like NFS).
* It's a regional resource.
* Automatically scales?

### DMS (Database Migration Service)

![Arch_AWS-Database-Migration-Service_48.svg](../../attachments/Arch_AWS-Database-Migration-Service_48.svg)

AWS DMS, allows moving data between a source database and a target database.Â The source and target databasesÂ can be of the same type or different types. 

The source can be a database on premise, an EC2 or an RDS. 
The target can be an EC2 or an RDS.

During the migration, your source database remains operational, reducing downtime for any applications that rely on the database.

**AWS Migration Hub** can be used to track the progress of migrations.

Uses cases:

* Database migration (to the cloud).
* Development and test database migration (copy production database to test database).
* Database consolidation (migrate multiple databases into one).
* Continuous database replication (disaster recovery or geographic separation).

---

### Other Databases

* **Amazon DocumentDB:** a document database service that supports MongoDB workloads.

* **Amazon Neptune:** a graph database service. For building and running applications that work with highly connected datasets, such as recommendation engines, fraud detection, and knowledge graphs.

* **Amazon QLDB (Amazon Quantum Ledger Database):** a ledger database service. For reviewing a complete history of all the changes that have been made to your application data.

* **Amazon Managed Blockchain:** a service that can be used to create and manage blockchain networks with open-source frameworks. Blockchain is a distributed ledger system that lets multiple parties run transactions and share data without a central authority.

* **Amazon ElastiCache:** a service that adds caching layers on top of databases to help improve the read times of common requests. It supports two types of data stores: Redis and Memcached.

* **Amazon DAX (DynamoDB Accelerator):** an in-memory cache for DynamoDB. It helps improve response times from single-digit milliseconds to microseconds.

# Application Integration

SQS queues are where messages are places until they are consumed.

---

### SQS (Simple Notification Service)

![Arch_Amazon-Simple-Notification-Service_48.svg](../../attachments/Arch_Amazon-Simple-Notification-Service_48.svg)

Similar to SQS, but can send notification to end users (publish/subscribe mode).
An SNS topic is a channel for messages to be deliverd.

# Analytics

---

### Kinesis

![Arch_Amazon-Kinesis_48.svg](../../attachments/Arch_Amazon-Kinesis_48.svg)

Collect, process, and analyze real-time data streams.

---

### Kinesis vs SQS FIFO

#### Kinesis Data Stream

Ordering Data with Kinesis is done by distributing data in the multiple shards available resulting in a kind of FIFO.

![AWS-Service-Kinesis-Ordering_Data.png](../../attachments/AWS-Service-Kinesis-Ordering_Data.png)

#### SQS FIFO

In a SQS FIFO only one customer can be set if no Group IDs are configured.

Using a Group ID result in a similar approach to Kinesis. The key difference is that in order to add a customer it is necessary to add a Group ID (in Kinesis it is necessary to add shards, which cost more).
